In order to view any of the information the user is prompted to log in using a Google Authenicator. This protects the information of the users posting information and also encourages more authentic use of the app. By using a Google Authenticator rather than storing an email and password in the database ensures better security.

## Tech Match Concept 
In the world of programming and project management we all find ourselves on one end of the the below diagram, we have skills to build projects or projects to build. Often those two groups do not match up, until Tech Match!

## Basic User Experience

Once the user logs in for the first time, they will see their basic information which is pulled from Google. Then the user may create a customer profile and select if they would like to be a client or a programmer. They may also provide basic information and a link to either a GitHub or a website. 

Then they may create and view projects. The projects have budgets and programming/skills assigned to them to allow for the user to find projects within their scope. The user may also view start dates and deadlines for projects.

The user of the project may edit the project if the needs change along the way. There is a many to one relationship as a user can have many projects. Additionally, there is one to one relationship with the user to the client profile as its restricted to one profile per user. If a a user tries to create a second profile with the same Google account, they will be redirected back to their profile. They may delete that profile and then create a new one if those wish. 

The user may also view other profiles and connect with those users.
